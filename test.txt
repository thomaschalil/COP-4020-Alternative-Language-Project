- Java is a popular object-oriented programming language that has a strong community behind it and is known for being portable and performant. Building upon the Spring Framework, Spring Boot is a project that makes building and configuring production-quality, stand-alone Spring-based apps easier. Because of its robust batch processing, easy-to-use database operations using Spring Data, and extensive toolkit for web services, security, and other areas, it's an excellent option for corporate applications.
- Java is naturally object-oriented, supporting concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction. This is known as object-oriented programming, or OOP. These OOP ideas are used by Spring Boot to offer an organized and modular approach to handling application complexity. Unit testing in Java is supported by frameworks such as JUnit. These testing frameworks and Spring Boot work together flawlessly to make it simple to test web endpoints and mock components.
- Libraries Used: SpringWebMVC, Spring JPA, Commons-CSV, H2-Database
